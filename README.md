Hey, I'm Sawyer! I build tons of random websites, apps, or just projects in general. Basically all of my projects are built on Node, a JavaScript engine based on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. I'm currently working on a project for EAST (see [www.eastinitiative.org/](https://www.eastinitiative.org/)) where I'm going to be creating an eSchoolPlus / Google Classroom alternative.

if you wish to contact me, I often use an app called [Discord](https://discord.com)! You can message me there, my tag is Sawy#6877!
